# Parallel Fraud Detection â€“ Progress Report

## Completed
- Dataset generator implemented (C++).
- Sample dataset with 1000 transactions created.
- Serial fraud detection algorithm (simple rules) implemented.
- Output anomalies saved to results/serial_output.txt.

## Next Steps
- Parallelize detection loop using OpenMP.
- Add execution time comparison between serial vs parallel.
- Write final report with analysis of speedup.
